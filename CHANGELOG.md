### Added: The Howitzer Walker, playable
- Owner accepted the updated local playtest on October 13: aim without holding fire, no close-ground aim freeze, and hide the pilot model/equipment while mounted. Implementation and correction record: [Howitzer Walker](docs/features/howitzer-walker.md).
- **The owner's Howitzer Walker is in the game:** a tall, two-legged artillery walker in riveted olive plate with a big howitzer in an open cradle, made from a Diesel Walker beside the Armoured Walker (`SDS / PWP / R R`: two steel blocks, a dispenser, steel plates, the Diesel Walker and pistons). It walks, turns, climbs and refuels as the other walkers do.
- **Mouse aims; hold use to fire the howitzer:** on the pilot's own Range Finder mark, else on the block they look at. The whole walker turns to face it and the barrel elevates (15 degrees down to 60 up) to the arc that lands a Heavy Shell there, about 115 blocks at most. It fires once laid, every 4 seconds, a shell from the pilot's inventory; the blast is damage-only, as every gun's.
- **Jump** crouches, then springs about three blocks up. **Attack stomps:** a hop (or, in the air, a slam) whose landing hurts and throws everything within 3.5 blocks for 14 damage.
- **Its animations, drawn from the owner-reviewed clips:** the floaty, bouncy walk; the shot's recoil, rocking hull, cartoon star burst and rolling smoke puffs; and the jump's crouch, tuck and squashy landing, fitted to the real leap. Game tests and a screenshot scene. Record: [howitzer-walker.md](docs/features/howitzer-walker.md).
