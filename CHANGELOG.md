# Changelog

Every change to Jugcraft, newest first, grouped by pull request. For what each thing does in game, see [docs/TECH_TREE.md](docs/TECH_TREE.md). For a full inventory with APIs and file locations, see [docs/WHAT_EXISTS.md](docs/WHAT_EXISTS.md).

**Testing so far:** everything compiles in CI, and the in-game tests (from #14 on) pass on a headless server. Nothing has been play-tested in a client or with two players on a dedicated server yet.

## Unreleased

No numbered release yet. Everything below is on `main`.

### #19 Machine control
- **Upgrades:** every powered processing machine gets two upgrade slots.
  - **Speed Upgrade:** 4 cards make it 3× as fast for twice the energy per item.
  - **Efficiency Upgrade:** 4 cards bring it to 41% of the energy.
  - Both are made from steel.
- **Redstone mode button:** ignored, run with a signal, or run without one.
- **Comparators** read stored energy (generators, battery box) or how full a machine is, from any block of a multi-block.
- Energy readouts are shortened (for example "12.5k / 20k JE") to fit the new slots.
- Four new game tests.

### #18 Steel tier
- **Coke Oven** (2 tall) bakes coal into **Coal Coke**. Coke is a 3,200-tick generator fuel and the carbon for steel.
- **Steel Foundry** (3 tall) turns 1 iron ingot + 1 coke into 1 **steel ingot**.
- Both are unpowered brick multi-blocks with steampunk and classic models.
- New steel items: ingot, nugget, block, plate and gear.
- **Fix:** cables drew a connection arm to every face of a machine, even where no power goes in (for example all around the alloy smelter). Now the arm and the energy flow use the same check.
- Three new game tests, including one for the cable fix.

### Merged 30 September 2026: PRs #8–#17

These were built as a stack, each on the one before, and merged in order (#8 first).

#### #17 Changelog and "What Exists" guide
- Adds this `CHANGELOG.md` and [`docs/WHAT_EXISTS.md`](docs/WHAT_EXISTS.md). WHAT_EXISTS is a map of all content, shared APIs, data formats, file locations and check rules, so contributors and AI agents can build alongside the existing systems.
- Adds feature records for [item logistics](docs/features/item-logistics.md) and [ore processing](docs/features/ore-processing.md).

#### #16 Ore processing depth
- **New machines:**
  - **Pulverizer:** ore → 2 dust, plus a byproduct roll.
  - **Ore Washer:** ore + water → 3 washed ore, which the pulverizer grinds.
  - **Sieve:** gravel → flint; soul sand → soul soil; both with small finds.
  - **Sawmill:** log → 6 planks + sawdust; planks → 3 sticks.
- **Three ore routes:** smelt (×1), crush or pulverize (×2), wash then pulverize (×3).
- **New items:**
  - 10 metal dusts (`c:dusts/<metal>`), which smelt into ingots. Nickel, tungsten and uranium dust use the arc furnace.
  - 10 washed ores.
  - Sawdust (4 → paper).
- **Byproducts:**
  - Machine recipes can list byproducts: chance, count, and an optional feature switch.
  - The pulverizer, sieve and sawmill have two byproduct slots, and a machine waits rather than lose a byproduct.
  - Byproduct pairs follow real ores, for example copper → gold and lead → silver.
- **Looks:** steampunk models (ball mill, washing vat with a water wheel, shaker sieve, sawbench) and classic textures.
- **Balance checks:** only ores get a bonus (×3 at most); byproducts add at most 25% of the input's metal; renewable sieve finds average under a nugget per operation.
- Seven new game tests.

#### #15 Item logistics
- **Side configuration:** every processing machine's screen has six face buttons (front, back, left, right, top, bottom). Each cycles between In, Out, Both and Off. The defaults keep the old hopper behavior.
- **Eject:** when on, the machine pushes its results out of its Out faces, 16 items every 8 ticks.
- **New blocks and items:**
  - **Brass Item Pipe:** 6 px. Items go first to matching sorters, then round-robin to the other inventories.
  - **Pneumatic Extractor:** 16 items every 8 ticks; a redstone signal pauses it.
  - **Item Sorter:** 9-slot filter.
  - **Brass Wrench:** turns machines; sneak to dismantle.
- Three new game tests.
- Fix: a multi-block machine's eject never feeds back into its own other blocks.

#### #14 Machine recipes as data, and in-game tests
- Machine recipes are now real Minecraft recipe types (`jugcraft:crushing`, `alloying`, …), one JSON file each under `data/<ns>/recipe/<type>/`. Data packs can add, change or remove them, and ingredients may be tags.
- In-game tests (Fabric game test API) run in CI with `./gradlew build`.
- **Launch-blocking fixes found by those tests** (before this PR, `main` could not start a server):
  - Fabric Loader 0.18.4 → **0.19.3**, which Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3 requires.
  - Ore worldgen moved to the 26.x format: `worldgen/feature/`, no `config` wrapper, block states as plain IDs.

#### #13 Steampunk machines
- Every machine redrawn as a detailed steampunk model: brass, copper, riveted iron, gauges, gears, valve wheels, and fireboxes that glow while running. Includes 37 original textures.
- The previous look stays available as the built-in resource pack **Jugcraft: Classic Machines**, so the change can be reverted.

#### #12 2×2 alloy smelter and power sockets
- The alloy smelter becomes a 2×2 multi-block with a visible copper **power socket**, the only place cables connect to it.
- Clear power-connection rules for every machine: each one either has a socket or takes power on any face that touches a cable.

#### #11 Multi-block machines
- Machines can occupy several blocks and are placed as one item, in the style of Immersive Engineering. Breaking any part removes the whole machine.
- **Geothermal Generator** (2 wide, lava → 64 JE/t) and **Wind Turbine** (3 tall, 4–24 JE/t by height and weather).

#### #10 Fluids, and tech-mod style cables and pipes
- **Bronze Fluid Pipe**, **Tinplate Tank** (16 buckets) and **Electric Pump**.
- Cables and pipes are thin (4 px) and connect to each other and to anything with energy or fluid storage, as in other tech mods. Items show as 3D segments.

#### #9 Parts and circuits
- **Metal Press** (ingot → plate), **Wire Drawer** (ingot → 3 wires), **Circuit Assembler** (basic and advanced circuits).
- Gears are crafted from four plates.

#### #8 Alloy smelter
- **Alloy Smelter** makes bronze, **brass**, **invar** and **solder** at metal-conserving ratios.

### Merged earlier on 30 September 2026

#### #7 Solar panel and steam generator
- **Solar Panel** (8 JE/t in sun) and **Steam Generator** (coal or bitumen plus water → 64 JE/t), plus a machine roadmap.

#### #6 Electricity and the first machines
- Jugcraft Energy (JE) with a shared `EnergyStorage` API, **Copper Cable** networks, **Coal Generator**, **Battery Box**, **Electric Furnace**, **Crusher** (ore doubling) and the **Arc Furnace** 3×3×3 multiblock.

#### #5 Base materials
- Zinc, lead, silver, nickel, tungsten, uranium, aluminum (bauxite), salt, phosphate, lithium (lepidolite), rare earths (monazite), sulfur, silicon and oil sand (bitumen).
- Feature switches in `config/jugcraft.properties`.

#### #4 Fabric 26.3 scaffold, tin and bronze
- Pinned toolchain and the CI Build workflow.
- Tin ore, raw tin, ingots and blocks, and bronze from a 3:1 copper/tin blend.
- The offline data generator and checker (`tools/`).

#### #1 Vision and development setup
- Project vision, contribution rules, design and architecture documents, and owner-directed Fabric development.
